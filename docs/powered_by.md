## Uber

Hoodie was originally developed at [Uber](https://uber.com), to achieve [low latency database ingestion, with high efficiency](http://www.slideshare.net/vinothchandar/hadoop-strata-talk-uber-your-hadoop-has-arrived/32).
It has been in production since Aug 2016, powering highly business critical (7/10 most used including trips,riders,partners totalling 100s of TBs) tables on Hadoop. It also powers several incremental Hive ETL pipelines and being currently integrated into Uber's data dispersal system.
